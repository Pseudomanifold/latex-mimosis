\noindent This package contains a minimal, modern template for writing your
thesis. While originally meant to be used for a Ph.\,D.\ thesis, you can
equally well use it for your honour thesis, bachelor thesis, and so
on---some adjustments may be necessary, though.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Why?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

I was not satisfied with the available templates for \LaTeX{} and wanted
to heed the style advice given by people such as Robert
Bringhurst~\cite{Bringhurst12} or Edward R.\
Tufte~\cite{Tufte90,Tufte01}. While there \emph{are} some packages out
there that attempt to emulate these styles, I found them to be either
too bloated, too playful, or too constraining. This template attempts to
produce a beautiful look without having to resort to any sort of hacks.
I hope you like it.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{How?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The package tries to be easy to use. If you are satisfied with the
default settings, just add
%
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{mimosis}
\end{verbatim}
%
at the beginning of your document. This is sufficient to use the class.
It is possible to build your document using either \LaTeX|, \XeLaTeX, or
\LuaLaTeX. I personally prefer one of the latter two because they make
it easier to select proper fonts.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Making this template \emph{yours}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Prior to using this template, the first thing you want to do is probably
a little bit of customisation. You can achieve quick changes in look and
feel by picking your own fonts. With the \verb|fontspec| package loaded
and  \XeLaTeX or \LuaLaTeX as your compiler, this is pretty simple:
%
\begin{verbatim}
\setmainfont{Your main font}
\setsansfont{Your sans-serif font}
\setmonofont{Your monospaced font}
\end{verbatim}
%
Make sure to select nice combinations of that are pleasing to
\emph{your} eyes---this is your document and it should reflect your own
style. Make sure to specify font names as they are provided by your
system. For instance, you might want to use the following combination:
%
\begin{verbatim}
\setmainfont{Libre Baskerville}
\setsansfont[Scale=MatchLowercase]{IBM Plex Sans}
\setmonofont[Scale=MatchLowercase]{IBM Plex Mono}
\end{verbatim}
%
If these fonts exist on your system, your normal text will look
{\fontspec{Libre Baskerville}{a little bit different from the other font used
in this example PDF}}, while your sans-serif font {\fontspec[Scale=MatchLowercase]{IBM Plex Sans}will 
pair nicely with your} {\fontspec[Scale=MatchLowercase]{IBM Plex Mono}{monospaced font}}.
%
You can also remove the \verb|Scale| directive, but I find that most
fonts pair better if they are adjusted in size a little bit. Experiment
with it until you finds a combination that you enjoy.

    A list of the most relevant packages required~(and automatically imported) by this template.

  \label{tab:Packages}
\end{table}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The template automatically imports numerous convenience packages that
aid in your typesetting process. \autoref{tab:Packages} lists the
most important ones. Let's briefly discuss some examples below. Please
refer to the source code for more demonstrations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Typesetting mathematics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This template uses \verb|amsmath| and \verb|amssymb|, which are the
de-facto standard for typesetting mathematics. Use numbered equations
using the \verb|equation| environment.
%
If you want to show multiple equations and align them, use the
\verb|align| environment:
%
\begin{align}
    V &:= \{ 1, 2, \dots \}\\
    E &:= \big\{ \left(u,v\right) \mid \dist\left(p_u, p_v\right) \leq \epsilon \big\}
\end{align}
%
Define new mathematical operators using \verb|\DeclareMathOperator|.
Some operators are already pre-defined by the template, such as the
distance between two objects. Please see the template for some examples. 
%
Moreover, this template contains a correct differential operator. Use \verb|\diff| to typeset the differential of integrals:
%
\begin{equation}
  f(u) := \int_{v \in \domain}\dist(u,v)\diff{v}
\end{equation}
%
You can see that, as a courtesy towards most mathematicians, this
template gives you the possibility to refer to the real numbers~$\real$
and the domain~$\domain$ of some function. Take a look at the source for
more examples. By the way, the template comes with spacing fixes for the
automated placement of brackets.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Typesetting text}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Along with the standard environments, this template offers
\verb|paralist| for lists within paragraphs.
%
Here's a quick example: The American constitution speaks, among others, of
%
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item life
  \item liberty
  \item the pursuit of happiness.
\end{inparaenum}
%
These should be added in equal measure to your own conduct. To typeset
units correctly, use the \verb|siunitx| package. For example, you might
want to restrict your daily intake of liberty to \SI{750}{\milli\gram}.

Likewise, as a small pet peeve of mine, I offer specific operators for
\emph{ordinals}. Use \verb|\th| to typeset things like July~4\th
correctly. Or, if you are referring to the 2\nd edition of a book,
please use \verb|\nd|. Likewise, if you came in 3\rd in a marathon, use
\verb|\rd|. This is my 1\st rule.

If you want to write a text in German and use German hyphenation rules, set the language of your text to german using \verb|\selectlanguage{ngerman}|, or add
\begin{verbatim}
\PassOptionsToPackage{spanish}{babel}
\end{verbatim}
before the \verb|\documentclass| command to load a specific language. The languages \verb|ngerman|, \verb|french|, and \verb|english| are loaded by default, with \verb|english| being selected.

Quotation marks can be typeset using the \verb|\enquote{...}| command from the \verb|csquotes| package, which is preloaded by \verb|latex-mimosis|.
Depending on the currently selected language, quotes will look like \enquote{this},
\selectlanguage{ngerman}\enquote{this}\selectlanguage{english},
or
\selectlanguage{french}\enquote{this}\selectlanguage{english}.
One must never use "ASCII" quotation marks or even 'apostrophe' symbols.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Changing things}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Since this class heavily relies on the \verb|scrbook| class, you can use
\emph{their} styling commands in order to change the look of things. For
example, if you want to change the text in sections to \textbf{bold} you
can just use
%
\begin{verbatim}
  \setkomafont{sectioning}{\normalfont\bfseries}
\end{verbatim}
%
at the end of the document preamble---you don't have to modify the class
file for this. Please consult the source code for more information.
