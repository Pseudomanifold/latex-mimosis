% Some adjustments to make the bibliography more clean
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The subsequent commands do the following:
%  - Removing the month field from the bibliography
%  - Fixing the Oxford commma
%  - Suppress the "in" for journal articles
%  - Remove the parentheses of the year in an article
%  - Delimit volume and issue of an article by a colon ":" instead of
%    a dot ""
%  - Use commas to separate the location of publishers from their name
%  - Remove the abbreviation for technical reports
%  - Display the label of bibliographic entries without brackets in the
%    bibliography
%  - Ensure that DOIs are followed by a non-breakable space
%  - Use hair spaces between initials of authors
%  - Make the font size of citations smaller
%  - Fixing ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so) on by using
%    superscripts

% Remove the month field from the bibliography. It does not serve a good
% purpose, I guess. And often, it cannot be used because the journals
% have some crazy issue policies.
\AtEveryBibitem{\clearfield{month}}
\AtEveryCitekey{\clearfield{month}}

% Fixing the Oxford comma. Not sure whether this is the proper solution.
% More information is available under [1] and [2].
